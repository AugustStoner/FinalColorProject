I did not advance as far as I hoped with this project, but it feels like a very strong start that can be extended later. From the start of this project, I think I progressed farthest when it comes to interface development in Java, as I had never worked with Swing before. I still have quite a bit to work on when it comes to documenting/explaining my code throughout using comments. While I would have loved to take the project further, I am happy with the end point for now, and will have opportunities to expand upon my work in the future. I would like to develop a random palette button, a different version of the program focusing on mixing colors together rather than modifying them individually, analysis of colors, group modification of colors, and the ability to export an image of the generated palette. While some of these stray a bit far from what I have implemented so far, my existing project would be used as the basis for all future development, and it has been satisfying to complete the current stage of it. I think other versions of controls for this project could be useful in the future, such as a slider for the HSB values in particular.
